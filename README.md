# SnapCap
## Project Vision
We are four students studying computer science at the Claremont Colleges. SnapCap is an undergraduate software development project that we developed to add emotional intelligence and reflection to the caption creation process.

## files
The files are structured in MVC style, so that the controller mediates interaction between the model and the view.
